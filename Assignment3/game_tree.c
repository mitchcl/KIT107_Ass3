/*
 *	Game Tree ADT Implementation
 *	Author: Elijah Gladdish 559819 &
 *	Version: May 2023
 *	
 *	This file holds the game_tree ADT which is a
 *	general game tree.  The game_tree is built using
 *	t_node ADTs.  A game_tree variable consists of a
 *	"root" field which refers to a t_node variable
 *	which has a "data" field and "child" and
 *	"sibling" references, and a "level" value.
 *	
 *	YOU NEED TO MAKE CHANGES TO THIS FILE!
